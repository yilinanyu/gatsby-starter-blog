As we all known, due to historical CV19, most of our life get affected in this way or other. But if's the universe has a reason for that, have you think about what would that be?

I am a big believer in "Secret" mindset. I do believe something comes in with a particular reason. If CV19 is what we attracted, what it wants to bring to our life? I cannot talk to lots of people; for myself, here are how things get changed. 

1. Grateful for lots of things. 

Grateful for my job, before, I have been through a particular phase when you don't like the job I do: I think I can do better than that, the position I am doing not creative and boring, etc. Lots of people are losing their jobs. But for myself, I can use all the hardware brought from work and enjoying the best, most cooling technology. And woke up at 9 am and working from home wearing pajama with food on the table, plus getting opportunities to learn, lead, share. 

Grateful for lots of things I take granted for. I am thankful for I have a lovely place to stay, fresh food delivered to home. When sanitizing or cooking these, I become more grateful for all the meals, fresh nutritions I got and even become a better chef :) 

Right now, the first thing I do to start my day is writing my "grateful journey" by listing five things I grateful for every day. 

2. Connect with your loved one. 

Stay home with your loved one. Enjoy the moment better. I used to talk with my parents maybe only once a week, now gets more often. Start taking caring, connecting to your loved one more than we used to.

3. Get More Time to Work on Hobby:

Since we got more time to spend, I started my progress for the project I always want to do, here it is, writing is one of them. 

4. Take care of your body More:

Nothing is more important than your body, start making better skincare and body care, and work out routine. Since I know, one day, we will still come out to see the world with glowing skin and fit and healthy body. 

5. Be a cleaner person:

Wash your hand, and take a shower. Now it's essential. 

6. Make some home improvement projects. 

I used to think the home may stay 1-2 years, don't need to invest more, but now I think, if you not in the mode of dream home mode, dream home will not come. Also, we don't know when you will be out of the shelter. So wherever you live, be respectful to, and make yourself happy for where your body and soul live. 

7. Start using reusable products

I used to not a big fan of reusable products. I thought the composed products had brought us productivity and efficiency. But due to all the toiler paper shortage, start thinking, do we need all of those? I begin using kitchen towels rather than a paper towel, also thinking maybe upgrade the toiler to water flush. 

8. Spend money on something that you really need. 

Since staying home order, you may realize your monthly expense reduced somehow. It's the right time to recognize what you should spend in your life. Be a clean, neat, minimalistic person, thinking if you need something. 

That's 8 things I have changed; if you scan the words above, most of the words i have seen is "More". Overall I am more than happy to stay home enjoying the moment we got. I do believe everything that happens is a good thing; it will guide you to where you want to go. It's just a matter of time and matters of finding it out. Everything you are dreaming of, it may already be in your life. Be aware, the dream you have is a feeling rather than an object.  That feeling and memory can stay with you forever. 

Talking an example from my dream list #1  ", I want a two-floor house, with an office room and workout room." 

Do I have it now? Yes, I live in the second-floor condo, which is on the second floor. Yes, I share with the story with the neighbor, with a guest room I can use for office room and workout place. The real thing I want under that dream is not the object of  "Two-floor house with office room and workout place " is just a productive and healthy, clean lifestyle and a place full of love. 

Dream list #2: "I want to be the best seller in the New York Times":  Do I have it now? Yes, I only have written two articles so far, but I can bring the knowledge and energy to people around me during daily life, to people I know, to people I care about. Since influencing people in a good way is what I want in the end, it's just a matter of time and size. 

Same with mine, think of what you want. What's more important is figure out what's is the reason underneath. Then start enjoying the current moment in every single way, embrace life. Make every day the best version of yourself, assuming you are the actress/actor in your own movie. Once you have figured those things out, you will be in Autopilot mode (Disclose, Tesla is my dream list) :D
