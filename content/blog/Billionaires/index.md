"A good life is like a good movie."

By chance, one of my teachers recommended a reality show called Undercover Billionaires.

It is a documentary about making a business from one hundred dollars to one million dollars. Because it is so good, I can't help but watch eight episodes at a time using one night + day. I felt that I had learned a lot of methodologies. It is the best course as a business 101.

It summarizes the step by step guides needed to establish a business. I remember when I was in college, older alumni who studied in the United States said that "Since I have stayed in the United States, I feel that I can survive anywhere. Going back to Shanghai is not a bad choice". I start thinking about what does it feels like "Able to survive everywhere." Now, after watching this show, I think I really got what it means. 

This is the step by step business plan learned in the play:

## First step: Survive
*If you can't solve the roof problem, don't think of anything else*

I felt the same way. When I was still wandering around and renting a house, my heart was volatile. I just wanted to buy a house first and have not able to think of anything else. As Osuze Orman said, "Owning a home is a keystone of wealth - both financial affluence and emotional security."

So his first goal is to earn enough living expenses for three months, with an average of 1100 * 3 per month, and earn enough before thinking about the next step.

### How to make money when you are in survival mode: 

- Do not picky for work. At the same time, observe the market and establish contacts.
- Find demand first then provide products.
- Combine the sale with trend "In the tuyere, pigs can fly."


## Step Two: Research

After solved the survival problem, the next step is to find the local business center development center to find the direction of his entrepreneurship but try to have at least one or two vague directions, use the resources provided to do market research.

For example, he looked at the two industries of coffee and beer, hoping that they could help with further research. With their help, he was able to conclude that the average consumption of beer per household is much higher than the use of coffee.

He also did a local search for successful local small entrepreneurs. By chatting with them, he was able to establish contacts, and avoid the difficulties, got to know about the market 

After confirming the direction, he tried to understand the details of this market; every link should be clear, and seek a license,

## Steps Three: Lead a Team. 

He immediately wrote A job post: Say I want to build a small team that does... "..." welcome to register, we have an open interview.

Find people who are smarter than yourself and familiar with the field even he does't have any penny to pay those people yet. 

Assign positions to different backgrounds and personalities: beer, barbecue: marketing: publicity: wood: iron:
He is an excellent leadership which is the primary key to his success. I will write another blog talking about leadership. 

## Step Four: Funds

Start to accumulate enough initial funds for entrepreneurship.
He was able to generate more assets by buying low and sell high, i.e., flipping cars and real estate.  Although he hit lots of issue, he always able to resolve the problem and find a good deal with his sound knowledge of market value. 


## Step Five: Start

When you encounter difficulties, pivot via your creativity and find solutions,
Don't look for excuses, control your emotions, don't be afraid of any difficulty.
Still follow the trend, attend the competition, win the game to marketing your business and gain the success. Always be confident and put on action immediately on your dream.
