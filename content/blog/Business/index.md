Hi Beauty, 

How have you been? It's been a while since I updated my blog. I hope you are safe and are doing well. I have been doing well too. There’s been lots of changes in my life in the past few months. I have felt a strong push from the universe to pursue my dreams - starting with this blog. I lost my "dream job" two months ago. But surprisingly, I am grateful and happier than ever because I know I would never have the strong courage to quit my high paying job and start my own business.

Now you know where I have been. I have been working on my business ground up. Right now I am busy launching our product, acquiring customers, and educating myself about a lot of things. Hence, today’s blog.

My dream has never changed. The focus of my blog has always been to help people achieve their financial freedom. To achieve that dream, you need to have knowledge, tools and consistent action. I wanted to start my journey to financial freedom like any other people. So I thought about doing it through real estate. I used to look at properties and analyze deals on my own, and I tell you, it’s not an easy task even if it may seem so. Later on, to make it easier for me, I created my very own Chrome Extension tool that can show cash flow on each property, without me having to do a lot of calculations.

The Chrome Extension is handy when you are looking for a house one by one, but it's not that efficient when you are analyzing the properties in bulk. This is when we came up with the idea of Real Cash App, the product that I have been meaning to introduce to you. We have been working on this app for a while now and I am very proud to introduce it to you today. 

We have received a lot of users already and we haven’t even officially announced it yet. That really excites me! I took a peek at some of the property cash flow results of some users and a lot of properties have cash flows more than 1,000 dollar a month with less than $30,000 down payment. Isn't it beautiful to start your journey with this tool?
