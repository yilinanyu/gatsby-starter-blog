Hi There, 

Thank you for being here, welcome to my blog. I want to use this article to introduce myself and talk about why I am here briefly. 

Recently, I watched a Ted Talks from Simon Sinek, which talks about "how great leaders inspire action," which is pretty impressive. It says most of the people only care what they do, some people think how to do, but few people think why they do that. The great inspiration should always start from the why. Feel free to worth to check it out. Then below is my why, how, and what. 

## Why:

I live in california, works in the industry as a software engineer. I am also an immigrant in the USA; I came to the united state for my master's degree. Until the last two to three years, I have never think about my why. As all the immigrants do, what we first struggle in the USA are physiological needs and safety needs based on Maslow's Hierarchy of needs.


After I got my dream job in my industry, I begin looking for what's my next step, what I really should do in my life. Then I looked for all kinds of class, books, material, and content. Finally, I start to find out my destination after listening to Dave Ramsey's podcast. I want to help people achieve their financial freedom. 

Also, in my free time, I like to read, mostly in finance, personal development. I have a few writers who have made a significant impact on my life. I want to be someone like them, can influence in an excellent way to the audience. 

So this is kind of the reason I am here.

## How:

With the reason of why, how seems easy?

- Providing great content: I will write one blog each week that falls into the below category or just some random topic, I thought. 
- Excellent tools:  In Chinese, we have a saying " Chef cannot cook well without a good knife" Luckily, as a software engineer, building tools become my skill set for living and also my hobby. Hopefully, they are useful to you as well. 
- Steps by step action plan: "Passion is empty without action" with all knowlege, goal, and tools, if we don't put on the action, those are nothing. That's why this section is also essential.
